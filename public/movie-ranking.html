<h1>Bob's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2><br />
<hr /><br />
<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p> Quirky stoner flick about an aging hippie who has to solve a crime for a disabled millionaire with the same name  
while dodging nihilists, pornographers, the chief of the Malibu police department, and other typical Los Angeles inhabitants.</p>
<h3>Apocalypse Now</h3>
<p>Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness but set in Vietnam instead of the Congo, with commentary on American foreign policy and pressure-driven insanity.</p>
<h3>The Score</h3>
<p>Robert DeNiro meets Edward Norton in a heist film based in Montreal.  DeNiro is hired by his "agent" and friend (played by Marlon Brando) to pull off a robbery with an inside man.</p>
